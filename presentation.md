# Presentation for Project 1 Game

### Features Included

**PLayer can win or lose** and the game doesn't last long. A quick 2-3
minute game.

**Real World based movements** using physics calculations such as
applying gravity, having friction or having an object speeding up and
when the player bounces into somethings else, it gets pushed by it.

**A game progress bar** which lets the player known how far away from
the winning point they are and also serves as and indicator to the
player, telling them that they are actually moving forward.

**A player's score** is based on how long they took to win. The lower
the better.

**Smooth Page Transitions** for better UX when navigating between the
landing page and the game page.

**Infinite background** to give the player an illusion that they are
moving forward at a fast pace when in reality, they are going 
very slow.

**Nyan Cat starts to chase you** down when you reach a third of the way to
the finish line.

### Technologies Used: 
    - jQuery
    - CSS Transitions/Animations
    - Javascript requestAnimationFrame()
    - Assets: gifs, png, jpg


### Constraints

Learning how to make a game run without being choppy while not using
better suited methods for making games for the web.

Learning to optimize game performance.

The amount of time was certainly not enough to deliver a solid,
well-tested MVP and learning new concepts while working on a project
takes its toll.

Thankfully, there were not much constraints in regards to the content
used in this project since of course, the Nyan Cat is really popular.

Having to re-write the core of the project due to lack of knowledge
of recommended ways to make such a game, which is why it had to be
re-wrote to use these new methods that I learnt. Lucky, I was using git
most of the time so I lucked out there.

Due to time constraint, browser compatability was not taken into
consideration for this project. So it will certainly encounter errors
when running in browsers other than Chrome and Firefox.


### Useful Information for Stakeholders

It really is a game that requires a high level of skill and timing to
win. It helps that the entry bar for this game is very low meaning that
all ages can enjoy this game.

Not mention that the controls are straight forward, no combinations,
and the game minics the real world environment, so when the yarn ball
falls, it bounces, and that is what is expected of the game. 

As the game is so simple but fun, it will be easy to further expand
the game to include features such as: high score saving, adding music
and dynamic sound effects or even power ups to introduce new
ways of playing which could lead to in-game transactions.
